# hello-world
My fisrt GitHub

Here is new some change!!
한글 지원도 되는것인가??
일본어 지원도? 특수문자도?
∞-∞=≠0, あいろ~

I also write some Ccode.

#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Wow! In GitHub can typing a Tab key which has a long space..");
	printf("Anymore It can also typing a tab key automacally.. I knew why many developers use GitHub!");
	return 0;
}

So, I stop writing. It is so valuable experience to me. Thank you.
